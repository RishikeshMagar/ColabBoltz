# ColabBoltz

ColabBoltz is an easy-to-use, Colab-compatible interface for [Boltz-2](https://github.com/jwohlwend/boltz), a model for protein–ligand complex structure prediction and affinity estimation.  

🧪 Inspired by [ColabFold](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold), this project aims to make Boltz more accessible to researchers through a streamlined web-based workflow — no local setup required.  

⚠️ Currently under active development.
